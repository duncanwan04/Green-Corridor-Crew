## Mission Statement
Urban transportation systems play a critical role in shaping how individuals access opportunities, services, and daily necessities, yet access to safe, efficient, and sustainable mobility remains unevenly distributed across cities. In Toronto, rapid urban growth, rising congestion, and increasing environmental pressures have intensified the need for transportation solutions that are not only efficient but also equitable and sustainable. Despite ongoing investments in public transit and active transportation infrastructure, significant disparities persist at the neighborhood level in terms of accessibility, safety, and infrastructure quality. These disparities can limit individuals’ ability to make informed, sustainable transportation choices and reinforce broader patterns of spatial inequality.

MoveGreen TO aims to address these challenges by providing a comprehensive, data-driven platform that evaluates and compares walking, cycling, and transit options across census tracts. The application measures transportation performance through three core dimensions: accessibility, safety, and infrastructure, to generate clear, standardized scores for each mode of travel. By translating complex spatial data into intuitive insights, the app empowers users to identify the most suitable and sustainable transportation options within their neighborhoods.

Beyond individual decision-making, MoveGreen TO serves as a tool for advancing more equitable and sustainable urban mobility. It highlights gaps in infrastructure and service provision, supports evidence-based planning, and encourages shifts toward lower-emission modes of transportation. In doing so, the app contributes to a broader vision of a city where all residents have the ability to move safely, efficiently, and sustainably, regardless of where they live.

## App Characteristic
The MoveGreen TO app is designed to provide an interactive way for users to explore sustainable transportation methods across neighborhoods in Toronto and decide which method is most accessible, safe, and practical in their neighborhood.  

A key feature of the app is its ability for users to seamlessly switch between the different transportation modes, select their census tract, and view an overall score for that specific mode of transportation in their census tract on a 0 to 1 scale, with 1 being the best in terms of safety, accessibility, and infrastructure availability. On the combined map, users can compare these scores across each mode of transportation. They can also see the density of transportation infrastructure available, the composite accessibility score, and how their census tract ranks in safety for that mode of transportation (cycling and walking only) compared to other census tracts. 

Users can compare transportation scores and real-world usage patterns using a swipe tool, allowing them to visually examine differences between the indices and scores, and the percentage of residents using each mode of transportation within a census tract. This enables them to identify spatial mismatches between infrastructure and behavior, such as areas with high accessibility but low usage, or vice versa. These features enable users to identify areas that perform well or poorly under different sustainable transportation methods. The app is structured around both mode selection and score comparisons (e.g., top- and bottom-performing neighborhoods). This makes it easier for users to quickly assess whether an area is relatively well-served or underserved in terms of accessibility.


## Methodology
Practicality of a transportation method is based on the presence of infrastructure, such as sidewalks for walking and cycling networks for biking. The modes of public transit considered include Subways, Light Rail Transit (LRT), Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), GO Train, and Priority bus corridors, combined in an overall composite index to represent the presence of transit infrastructure in each census tract. The assumption is that if the majority of the census tract (over 50%) can access their nearest transit stop within 10 to 15 minutes, which is approximately an 800-meter distance, that choice of transportation is considered practical. Safety for cycling and walking is measured according to the frequency of death-inducing or serious injuries causing car collisions with cyclists and pedestrians, respectively, in each census tract. Further, accessibility is measured according to Statistics Canada’s Spatial Access measures that quantify the ease of reaching destinations of varying levels of attractiveness from an origin. The composite accessibility indices for each census tract represent the ease with which residents can access health care facilities, employment, sports and recreation facilities, education facilities (primary, secondary, and post-secondary), cultural and arts facilities, child care, and grocery stores (within one, three, or five minutes). The scores from these ten measures were combined to create one equally weighted accessibility measure. Together, the overall walking, cycling, and transit score that each user sees for their census tract is a weighted average of standardized safety, infrastructure, and accessibility measures. Importantly, standardization allows for the measures to be comparable by preventing any single variable from disproportionately influencing the index due to differences in scale.

### Methodological Notes

The transportation scores are based on a weighted combination of:

- **Infrastructure**
- **Safety**
- **Accessibility**

#### Infrastructure
Practicality is measured based on the presence of transportation infrastructure, such as:

- sidewalks for walking
- cycling networks for biking
- transit infrastructure for public transit

Public transit infrastructure includes:

- Subway
- Light Rail Transit (LRT)
- Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
- GO Train
- Priority bus corridors

A transportation option is considered practical when most of the census tract can access the nearest stop or network within about **10 to 15 minutes**, or roughly **800 metres**.

#### Safety
Safety for cycling and walking is measured using the frequency of severe or fatal collisions involving cyclists and pedestrians in each census tract.

#### Accessibility
Accessibility is measured using spatial access indicators that estimate how easily residents can reach important destinations, including:

- health care facilities
- employment
- sports and recreation
- education
- cultural and arts facilities
- child care
- grocery stores

These measures are combined into a standardized composite accessibility index.

#### Final Scores
The final **Walking**, **Cycling**, and **Public Transit** scores are weighted averages of standardized infrastructure, safety, and accessibility measures. Standardization ensures that no single measure dominates the index due to scale differences.
